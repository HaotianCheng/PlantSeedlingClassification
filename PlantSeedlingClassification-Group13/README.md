# PlantSeedlingClassification-Group12
Database: https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification/data
the Sprint2 python script shows how we load and preprocess the Train Data and Test Data(Mask the train Data).
In Sprint3, We extract the bottled-neck feartures using Xception Models from keras to improve the accuracy of the model.
We use two models (logistic regression, a self-written CNN fully connected layers) to train the data we processed and we compare the results.
In Sprint 4, we build a website for users to upload the images and return the species of the plant seedlings if available.
